Custom Blocks for headless WordPress

== Description ==

Qroko Blocks is a plugin for adding custom blocks to Gutenberg.

Our main goal was to make writing on Gutenberg easier. Mainly used with the theme "Qroko", which uses WordPress as a headless CMS. However, we have tried to design it so that it is not dependent on other themes as well.

The motif is a kabuki kuroko, which will play an active role offstage in your website production.
